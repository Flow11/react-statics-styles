React Nexus Styles
==================

Note: this package is part of the React Nexus framework, but is intented to be totally usable stand-alone.
You DONT need to adopt the React Nexus framework to fully benefit from React Nexus Styles.

React Nexus Styles is a build-time processer which scans React class definitions for static styles and bundle them
into a stylesheet. This stylesheet may then be further post-processed (see the gulp example).
